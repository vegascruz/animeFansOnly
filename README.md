# Anime Fans Only 

This project is dedicated to anime fans only, or at least those that appreciate anime. 
The website is fairly simple. Designed using the Materialize CSS framework and data from two APIs called 'Waifu' and 'Anime Chan'. The API basically pulls a gif and a random anime quote from its corresponding database. We then placed that gif from the API database onto onto the page. Everytime you load the page, it's gonna populate with a new gif. The other API does the same thing, but the data feedback is an anime quote and author which will also repopulate every time you load the page. This website is mainly for recreational purposes.
