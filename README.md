# Anime Fans Only 

This project is dedicated to anime fans only, or at least those that appreciate anime. 
The website is fairly simple. We used two API's called 'Waifu' and 'Anime Chan'. The Waifu API basically pulls a gif from a database. We then placed that gif from that Db the response onto our page. Everytime you load the page, it's gonna populate with a new Gif. The other API does the same thing, but the item is an anime quote which will also repopulate every time you load the page. 
This can't really be used for a business purpose, but is just fun for people(anime fans only) to play with.
